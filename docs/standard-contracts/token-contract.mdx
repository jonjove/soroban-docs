# Standard Token Contract

The token contract is an implementation of [CAP-54 Smart Contract Standardized Asset].

[CAP-54 Smart Contract Standardized Asset]: https://stellar.org/protocol/cap-54

:::caution
The token contract is in early development, has not been audited, and is not
intended for use. Report issues

## Overview

Tokens are a vital part of blockchains, and contracts that implement token
functionality are inevitable on any smart contract platform. Instead of
expecting a standard to emerge from the ecosystem, we provide our own token
contract implementation. This has a couple advantages. First, we can special
case this contract and run it natively instead of running in a WASM VM, reducing
the cost of using the contract. Second, we can use this native contract to allow
"classic" Stellar assets to interoperate with smart tokens. The current
iteration of the standard token contract doesn't run natively or interoperate
with "classic" Stellar assets, but these improvements will be made in the
future. 

The standard token contract is similar to the widely used ERC-20 token standard,
which should make it easier for existing smart contract developers to get
started on Stellar.

Note that this standard token contract does not prevent the ecosystem from
developing other token contracts if the one we provide is missing functionality
they require.

## Token contract authorization semantics 

The token contract contains three kinds of operations

- gettors, such as `balance`, which do not change the state of the contract
- unprivileged mutators, such as `approve` and `xfer`, which change the state of
the contract but do not require special privileges
- privileged mutators, such as `burn` and `set_admin`, which change the state of
the contract but require special privileges

Gettors require no authorization because they do not change the state of the
contract and all contract data is public. For example, `balance` simply returns
the balance of the specified identity without changing it.

Unprivileged mutators require authorization from some identity. The identity
which must provide authorization will vary depending on the unprivileged
mutator. For example, a "grantor" can use `approve` to allow a "spender" to spend
the grantor's money up to some limit. So for approve, the grantor must provide
authorization. Similarly, a "sender" can use `xfer` to send money to a
"recipient". So for `xfer`, the sender must provide authorization. The
authorization for an unprivileged mutator is a [KeyedAuthorization](#keyedauthorization-parameter)
because the identity that is providing the authorization must be specified.

Priviliged mutators require authorization from a specific privileged identity,
known as the "administrator". For example, only the administrator can `mint` more
of the asset. Similarly, only the administrator can appoint a new administrator.
The authorization for a privileged mutator is an [Authorization](#authorization-parameter)
because the identity that is providing the authorization is known to be the
administrator.

[Public types](https://github.com/stellar/soroban-token-contract/blob/main/src/public_types.rs) referenced below for the token contract

### Authorization parameter

Used by `mint`, `burn`, `freeze`, `unfreeze`, and `set_admin`. These functions
assume the `Authorization` is for the admin `Identifier`, which is why there are
no keys in `Authorization`.

### KeyedAuthorization parameter

Used by `allowance`, `approve`, `xfer`, and `xfer_from`. `KeyedAuthorization` is
for contract functions where the user is interacting with a balance or allowance in the token
contract. The user's identifier is specified as a key for
`KeyedAuthorization::Ed25519` and `KeyedAuthorization::Account`, while
`KeyedAuthorization::Contract` implies that the invoking contract's address is
the user.

### Signatures

For non-Contract authorization types, both `KeyedAuthorization` and
`Authorization` will include one of more signatures. Those signatures are
derived by signing the `Message` enum, which has one value at the moment, `V0`.
`Message::V0` requires the current nonce for the Identifier providing
authorization, a
[domain](https://github.com/stellar/soroban-token-contract/blob/main/src/cryptography.rs),
and the function parameters.

### Nonce

The token contract stores a nonce per `Identifier`. This nonce is required on
any function that requires authorization (The Signatures section above explain
how itâ€™s used). The current nonce for an `Identifier` can be retrieved using the
nonce contract function.

## Contract Interface

```rust
// Admin interface

// Sets the administrator to "admin". Also sets some metadata
fn initialize(e: Env, admin: Identifier, decimal: u32, name: Binary, symbol: Binary);

// If "admin" is the administrator, burn "amount" from "from"
fn burn(e: Env, admin: Authorization, from: Identifier, amount: BigInt);

// If "admin" is the administrator, mint "amount" to "to"
fn mint(e: Env, admin: Authorization, to: Identifier, amount: BigInt);

// If "admin" is the administrator, set the administrator to "id"
fn set_admin(e: Env, admin: Authorization, new_admin: Identifier);

// If "admin" is the administrator, freeze "id"
fn freeze(e: Env, admin: Authorization, id: Identifier);

// If "admin" is the administrator, unfreeze "id"
fn unfreeze(e: Env, admin: Authorization, id: Identifier);

// Token Interface

// Get the allowance for "spender" to transfer from "from"
fn allowance(e: Env, from: Identifier, spender: Identifier) -> BigInt;

// Set the allowance to "amount" for "spender" to transfer from "from"
fn approve(e: Env, from: KeyedAuthorization, spender: Identifier, amount: BigInt);

// Get the balance of "id"
fn balance(e: Env, id: Identifier) -> BigInt;

// Transfer "amount" from "from" to "to"
fn xfer(e: Env, from: KeyedAuthorization, to: Identifier, amount: BigInt);

// Transfer "amount" from "from" to "to", consuming the allowance of "spender"
fn xfer_from(e: Env, spender: KeyedAuthorization, from: Identifier, to: Identifier, amount: BigInt);

// Returns true if "id" is frozen
fn is_frozen(e: Env, id: Identifier) -> bool;

// Returns the current nonce for "id"
fn nonce(e: Env, id: Identifier) -> BigInt;

// Descriptive Interface

// Get the number of decimals used to represent amounts of this token
fn decimals(e: Env) -> u32;

// Get the name for this token
fn name(e: Env) -> Binary;

// Get the symbol for this token
fn symbol(e: Env) -> Binary;
```

## Running the token contract with testutils machinery
This section has more information about the testutils machinery (TODO: link to interacting-with-contracts.mdx testutils section)

This [test
case](https://github.com/stellar/soroban-token-contract/blob/37e2cd3580f8e28beea9e8f9194b9cf8547472dd/tests/test.rs#L20)
shows how the token contract should be used. Note that the actual call into the
contract is in the
[Token](https://github.com/stellar/soroban-token-contract/blob/37e2cd3580f8e28beea9e8f9194b9cf8547472dd/src/testutils.rs#L26)
wrapper test class.

## Signing messages

The two
[examples](https://github.com/stellar//soroban-token-contract/blob/37e2cd3580f8e28beea9e8f9194b9cf8547472dd/src/testutils.rs#L55)
from the test `Token` wrapper class demonstrate how you sign a contract function that expects an `Authorization` and a `KeyedAuthorization` type.

### Authorization
The admin must match the `Identifier` that was used to `initialize` the contract. 
```rust
pub fn mint(&self, admin: &Keypair, to: &Identifier, amount: &BigInt) {
    let mut args: Vec<EnvVal> = Vec::new(&self.env);
    args.push(to.clone().into_env_val(&self.env));
    args.push(amount.clone().into_env_val(&self.env));
    let msg = Message::V0(MessageV0 {
        nonce: self.nonce(&to_ed25519(&self.env, admin)),
        domain: Domain::Mint as u32,
        parameters: args,
    });
    let auth = Authorization::Ed25519(admin.sign(msg).unwrap().into_val(&self.env));
    mint(&self.env, &self.contract_id, &auth, to, amount)
}
```

### KeyedAuthorization
```rust
 pub fn approve(&self, from: &Keypair, spender: &Identifier, amount: &BigInt) {
    let mut args: Vec<EnvVal> = Vec::new(&self.env);
    args.push(spender.clone().into_env_val(&self.env));
    args.push(amount.clone().into_env_val(&self.env));
    let msg = Message::V0(MessageV0 {
        nonce: self.nonce(&to_ed25519(&self.env, from)),
        domain: Domain::Approve as u32,
        parameters: args,
    });
    let auth = KeyedAuthorization::Ed25519(KeyedEd25519Authorization {
        public_key: from.public.to_bytes().into_val(&self.env),
        signature: from.sign(msg).unwrap().into_val(&self.env),
    });
    approve(&self.env, &self.contract_id, &auth, spender, amount)
}
```
